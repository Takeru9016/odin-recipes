    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I made them for a potluck at work and have been asked for them ever since.
      (If you can keep people out of them, you're doing better than I ever
      could.) The time that I spend prepping this depends on how fast you shell
      your eggs. I have two girls so we knock this out in about 30 minutes
      (minus cooking time).

    <!--- Steps to make Deviled Eggs-->
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place eggs into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water. Bring
          to a boil and reduce heat to medium; boil eggs for 10 to 12 minutes.
          Drain the boiling water and fill pot with cold water. After 2 to 3
          minutes, pour off water and replace with more cold water. Repeat until
          eggs are fully chilled, 10 to 15 minutes. Peel eggs.
        </p>

          Heat vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat and cook and
          stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
          let cool.
        </p>

          Slice eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl; transfer
          egg white halves to a plate. Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir in sour
          cream, mayonnaise, ranch dressing, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion
          powder, and lemon pepper seasoning until yolk mixture is smooth. Stir
          in sauteed onions, bacon bits and Cheddar cheese.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          Generously fill egg halves with filling and sprinkle each deviled egg
          with paprika. Refrigerate until chilled before serving.
